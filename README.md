# BookList
Textbooks and readers for college courses are too expensive. Often times you buy the book for an exorbitantly high price and then are forced to sell it back to the school for a fraction of what you paid originally. Our book exchange will create a platform for students to search by department for students looking to sell or trade books. By giving students an opportunity to collaborate together to provide each other with books, we hope to lessen the financial stress placed on all students at the beginning of each semester.
